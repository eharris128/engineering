We are looking for someone to focus on (and ideally lead) our SaaS platform backend with all of its business logic and all of its 
infrastructure platform components. In addition to our external product customers you'll need to think about your internal platform customers (Full Stack and Frontend engineers) making sure they have a `NoOps` platform experience building new SaaS platform capabilities.

A platform thinking DNA and a cloud-native mindset with enough knowledge about the modern cloud-based application design patterns is critical for this role. Knowing when to build a `Kubernetes` and when to build a `Nomad` is important. Knowing the actual Kubernetes internals is a `nice to have` bonus too (not because we need to use Kubernetes, but because it's an example of a reusable platform-based solution).

Knowing Go already is useful, but not required. Going 
through the [`Tour of Go`](https://tour.golang.org) and reading the 
[`50 Shades of Go`](https://bit.ly/34Su1e7) blog post will make you productive on day one. If you do know Go you should be comfortable 
using this Golang [`project layout`](https://bit.ly/3gPF9uK).

### Must Have

* Experience building software running on one of the major IaaS clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure; ideally AWS)
* Docker (for local development and production)

### Nice to Have

* Golang (a decent tooling and package ecosystem background)
* Serverless functions
* Serverless.js
* Kubernetes (some developer and ops experience)
* Kubernetes internals/design/code
* Hashicorp and/or other cloud infrastructure tools background
* Previous experience building cloud-based platforms, cloud infrastructure platforms or cloud infrastructure management tools
