# Core Engine Developer/Lead - Linux System and Kernel Development

The core engine is the heart of our solution. It is responsible for understanding containers and what they are doing. 

We are looking for someone who's done system programming and who's familiar with, at least, some of the low level Linux capabilities and interfaces used for system profiling, performance monitoring and containers.

You'll be working on improving the core engine making it better for the open source community. You'll also integrate it with our SaaS platform.

* Docker internals (runc, containerd, OCI, etc)
* Kubernetes internals (CRI and container runtimes)
* Debugger internals
